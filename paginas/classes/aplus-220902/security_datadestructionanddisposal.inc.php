<h3>Security: Data Destruction and Disposal Methods</h3>

<img class="image-block" src="<?=$class_220902.'multimedia/'?>hddshred.png" />

<p class="pheader">Overview</p>

<p>It is of great importance to destroy data and dispose of the hardware or documents properly when they are no longer necessary. 
The disposable data might turn out to be very sensitive and can be used to the benefits of a blackhat hacker or thief.  
Lists with employee record information might grant a hacker physical access to a company by identity theft. Especially in huge companies where 
the security guard does not know all the faces of employees and works with a guest entry roster. 
Hard disks with corporate data that seem broken and rendered useless might still be fixable and/or partially readable. 
If not destroyed and disposed of properly, it might fall into the wrong hands. 
There are many ways that data and documents can fall into the wrong hands and benefit in dark schemes. 
Luckily there are proper ways of disposing and destruction and therefor it is important that an organization has a appropriate data destruction / disposal plan.</p>

<p class="pheader">Hard Drives</p>

<p>There are 3 key concepts in relation to the sensitive data contained on hard drives.</p>
	
	<table>
		<tr>
			<th>Concept</th>
			<th>Description</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Formatting</td>
			<td>Prepares drive to hold data, can overwrite data that is already there<br/>
				The old data is still accessible through special data recovery software until overwritten</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Sanitation</td>
			<td>Software that thoroughly wipes data off the drive<br/>
				It can take 6 to 7 writes on a specific drive <i>sector</i> to actually overwrite the old data</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Destruction</td>
			<td>Renders the drive no longer operational<br/>
				Destruction may be performed in many different ways</td>
		</tr>
	</table>


<p class="pheader">Destruction Methods</p>

	<table>
		<tr>
			<th>Method</th>
			<th>Description</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Shredder</td>
			<td>A Hard drive can be shredded (like any other type of media)<br/>
				After the process it will be a pile of broken and shredded pieces and rendered completely useless</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Drill / Hammer</td>
			<td>A way of physically destroying a hard drive on 'low budget'<br/>
				It is more time consuming when large amount of drives have to be destroyed but it brings the same results
				
					<ul class="magiclist">
						<li>remove hdd cover</li>
						<li>remove drive arm and cover over the platters</li>
						<li>goal is to turn shiny platter surfaces into a fine powder with a sander of some type</li>
						<li>following this use a power drill to create smallest particles possible</li>
					</ul>
					
				</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Degaussing (Electromagnetic)</td>
			<td>Involves applying a strong magnetic field to initialize the media<br/>
				Wand model degaussers are cheapest and start at around $ 500<br/>
				Desktop models often range up to $30,000<br/></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Incineration</td>
			<td>Completely burn the hard drive</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Certificate of Destruction</td>
			<td>Documents that attest to either the physical destruction of the media or an approved method of removal of that media</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
 
 <p class="pheader">Recycling or Repurposing: Best Practices</p>
 
 <p>Destruction is not always the way to go as a user or organization might want to reuse the media. 
 There are 2 ways of formatting a hard drive for reuse and it depends on the situation which one will be utilized.</p>
 
	<table>
		<tr>
			<th>Method</th>
			<th>Description</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Low level formatting</td>
			<td>This method of formatting is used to completely wipe data off the disk before reusing it</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Standard formatting</td>
			<td>This method marks currently occupied sectors of data as being available for data storage<br/>
				The old data actually still exists but is not 'noticed' by the OS</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	
<p>The formatting options in the operating system are <b>always</b> a <i>standard format</i> and do not actually wipe the disk clean.</p>

 <p>A common way of <b>sanitizing</b> a hard drive is to 'Overwrite' or replace all data with 0s. (Zero Out Data) Most software will overwrite with the same sequence multiple times to ensure 
that the previous data cannot be obtained.</p>
