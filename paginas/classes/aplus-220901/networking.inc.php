<h3>Networking 101</h3>

<p class="pheader">Overview</p>

<p>A <b>workgroup</b> or '<i>peer to peer</i>' network model is a simplistic type of network environment on which every client connected can provide some services.
There are no dedicated servers present and usually 'centralized administration' doesn't apply to the model.</p>

<p>A <b>domain</b> or '<i>client-server</i>' network model is a more complex type of network environment which is usually administrated from a centralized position on the network. 
Also it usually has one or multiple servers that provide every connected client with the necessary software to properly function.</p>

<p class="pheader">Cables and Connectors</p>

<p><b>UTP</b> (<i>Unshielded Twisted Pair</i>) and <b>STP</b> (<i>Shielded Twisted Pair</i>) are the common copper network cables that are used for ethernet traffic.
They consist of 8 small twisted cables encapsulated by cabling coat. STP are shielded with a type of aluminum insulation to protect the wires from EMR. 
All of the twisted pair cables suffer attenuation and thus are limited to 100 meters of maximum length.</p>


<p><b>Composite cables</b> can combine multiple cable types in one PVC jacket. Think of a combination of coaxial, cat5 into a single cable jacket.</p>

<p><b>Fiber Optic cabling</b> is light based through strands of glass instead of electrical signals through conductive media. Therefore fiber optics are not susceptible to EMI. 
It is also the fastest transmission media available and can cover vast distances of data transmission. Some downsides of fiber optics are that it is also the most expensive and 
delicate type of cabling.</p>

<p>Plenum is referred to as an enclosure in a building (room between 2 floors) to move are for heating, cooling or humidity control. 
It is also often used to run high and/or low voltage cables through the building. Cabling that runs through a plenum must meet certain protection and environmental requirements. (non toxic jackets at high temperature in example).</p>

<p class="pheader">Voice Over IP (VoIP)</p>
	
<p>Voice over IP (<i>VoIP)</i> is a technology that allows digital audio data over the networks. It is referred to as convergence technology. 
VoIP uses 2 protocols especially designed for it. The <i>Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)</i> is used for the initial connection.
The <i>Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP)</i> is used for voice data carriage.</p>
	
<p>A network protocol is needed for computers on a network to communicate. Th√© standardised protocol suite is <b>TCP/IP</b>.</p>

<h3>Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA)</h3>

<p>A range of automatically assigned link-local IP addresses for a network that cannot reach a DHCP.<br/>
