<h3>Displays</h3>

<p class="pheader">Overview</p>

<p>Back in the early days personal computers used CRT (Cathode Ray Tube) monitors. These monitors were big and heavy and used a vacuum tube that contained one or more electron guns and a phosphorescent screen to display images.</p>
<p>Nowadays the monitor market has been conquered by the LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) screens. These LCD screens are a lot smaller (flat screen) and are way more energy efficient.</p>
<p>When buying a LCD monitor there are several properties that you have to take into consideration.</p>

<p>LCD Displays</p>

<p>LCD displays work at the molecular level where crystals are being twisted to shine light through polarized filters. To be able to see light the LCD display needs backlight. Older LCD displays used fluorescent backlighting (CCFL - Cold Cathode Fluorescent Lamp) for this purpose. 
More modern LCD displays use LED backlights. So a LED display is actually a LCD display with LED backlight.</p>

<p>We will generally see 2 different LCD technologies out there but some older technologies are still around. The technologies and their respective properties are listed in the table below.</p>
